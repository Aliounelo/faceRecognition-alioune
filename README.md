<p>
This little project is study about as the title specifies : facial recognition. There are many algorithms for 
this, that's why we will focus on the theorical aspect of three techniques : 
<ul><li>Haar Cascade Classifiers</li>
<ul><li>Local Binary Pattern Histograms</li>
<ul><li>YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithms</li>

<span style="fontcolor:gray; text-align:center">We will do a summary and a why we choosed this for this ? In what is it better ? ...</span>
