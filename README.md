<p>
This little project is a study about object detection especially, Face recognition. 
<ul><li><b>Viola-Jones algorithm ( Machine Learning) : <br></b></li>
<p>This algorithm is widely used for face detection in the image or real-time. It performs Haar-like feature extraction from the image. This generates a large number of features. These features are then passed into a boosting classifier. This generates a cascade of the boosted classifier to perform image detection. An image needs to pass to each of the classifiers to generate a positive (face found) result. The advantage of Viola-Jones is that it has a detection time of 2 fps which can be used in a real-time face recognition system.</p>
<li><b>YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm (Deep Learning)</b></li>
 </ul>
