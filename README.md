<span style="text-decoration:strong; text-align:center">Face Recognition </span>

This little project is a study about object detection especially, Face recognition. Object detection is the technique of identifying objects present in images and videos. It is one of the most important applications of machine learning and deep learning.  There are many algorithms for that task, but we will only focus on two.
 
<ul><li><b>Viola-Jones algorithm ( Machine Learning) : <br></b></li>
<p>This algorithm is widely used for face detection in the image or real-time. It performs Haar-like feature extraction from the image. This generates a large number of features. These features are then passed into a boosting classifier. This generates a cascade of the boosted classifier to perform image detection. An image needs to pass to each of the classifiers to generate a positive (face found) result. The advantage of Viola-Jones is that it has a detection time of 2 fps which can be used in a real-time face recognition system.</p>
<li><b>Convolutional Network Neurons :</b></li>
 <p>Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most popular ways of doing object recognition. It is widely used and most state-of-the-art neural networks used this method for various object recognition related tasks such as image classification. This CNN network takes an image as input and outputs the probability of the different classes. If the object present in the image then it’s output probability is high else the output probability of the rest of classes is either negligible or low. The advantage of Deep learning is that we don’t need to do feature extraction from data as compared to machine learning. </p>
 </ul>

<span style="fontcolor:gray;">We will do a summary and a why we choosed this for this ? In what is it better ? ...</span>
